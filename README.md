## Dynamic routes


This project also demonstrates how to work with dynamic routes in a React application. Dynamic routing allows you to create routes that can respond to different parameters and paths, making your app more flexible and powerful.

## How Dynamic Routes Work
In the app, routes are defined in such a way that certain URL paths can dynamically change based on user input or parameters. For example, you might have a URL structure like:

`/products/:id`

Where :id is a dynamic parameter representing the ID of a product. The app will dynamically render the product details based on the id passed in the URL.

### Example of Dynamic Route in Use
1. Navigate to a page that lists items such as products or services.
2. Click on an item, which will take you to a dynamically generated route.
3. The page will display content based on the dynamic parameter in the URL (e.g., product ID, user profile, etc.).
This dynamic behavior is handled using React Router, which makes the creation and handling of dynamic routes seamless in a single-page application.
